/**
 * # Cortex M: Prepared Command
 *
 * Allows batching of Cortex M-related commands, such as writing to a register,
 * halting and resuming the core.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * When preparing the sequence of commands, we can use the same API to prepare
 * a command as we would to execute them immediately.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Note that only the .go method is asynchronous.
 *
 * const prep = core.prepareCommand();
 * prep.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.R0, 0x1000);
 * prep.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.R1, 0x0);
 * prep.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.PC, 0x2000000);
 * prep.resume();
 * ```
 *
 * We can then execute them as efficiently as possible by combining them together
 * and executing them like so.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * await prep.go();
 * ```
 *
 * The code above is equivalent to the following _non-prepared_ command:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * await core.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.R0, 0x1000);
 * await core.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.R1, 0x0);
 * await core.writeCoreRegister(CortexReg.PC, 0x2000000);
 * await core.resume();
 * ```
 *
 * Since the batched version of this code avoids making three round-trips to the
 * target, we are able to significantly improve performance. This is especially
 * noticable when uploading a binary to flash memory, where are large number of
 * repetetive commands are being used.
 *
 * ## Explanation
 *
 * For a detailed explanation of why prepared commands are used in DAP.js, see the
 * documentation for `PreparedDapCommand`.
